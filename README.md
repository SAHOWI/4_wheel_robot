# 4 Wheel Robot Project

REMARK: This is my first repository created and managed by gh cli tool!

## This will become my first 4 Wheel Robot Project

## Project Goals

- 4 Weheels (omniwheels)
- basic control by Arduino (or similar)
- complex control (Path finding, OpenVC) by Raspberry 4
- Camera
- LIDAR


## Intended Tools

### Design 
- OpenCAD to make Overall Designe and derive to be 3D printed Parts
- Blender to create some nice videos to showcase how the robot *could* look like in real world
  (not saying it will never - but the initial version has no wheater-proof design aspects (rain, dust, general moisture, heat, ...)

### Simulation

- Gazebo / RVIz to run simulations 

### Programming Languages, Tools, OSes
- GIT :-) (yes, Im here - right?)
- C++ 
- Python
- MS Visual Studio Code
- Ubuntu Linux



## Why am I doing this at all?

The main goal for myself ist to practice all the mentioned Tools above.
Most of them I'm using already a long time - but no all the possibilities provided by them are used regulary.
That is why I'm doing this - practice, practice, practice. And lear new things. And share them with you.
Allthough I believe not all I'm sharing here must be new to you as well.
